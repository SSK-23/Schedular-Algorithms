# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** that supports multiple scheduling algorithms, allowing users to simulate and analyze process scheduling scenarios. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Users can input process details such as arrival time, run time, and quantum (for Round Robin).
- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**:
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF) (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
  - Round Robin (RR)
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Displays execution order, waiting times, turnaround times, and averages.
